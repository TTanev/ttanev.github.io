                    <p>Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,<br>
                        Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—<br>
                        While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,<br>
                        As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door—<br>
                        "‘Tis some visitor," I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—<br>
                        Only this and nothing more.”<br>
                        <br>
                        Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;<br>
                        And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.<br>
                        Eagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow<br>
                        From my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—<br>
                        For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—<br>
                        Nameless here for evermore.<br>
                        <br>
                        And the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain<br>
                        Thrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;<br>
                        So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating,<br>
                        "‘Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door—<br>
                        Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;—<br>
                        This it is and nothing more.”<br>
                        <br>
                        Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,<br>
                        “Sir," said I, “or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;<br>
                        But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,<br>
                        And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,<br>
                        That I scarce was sure I heard you”—here I opened wide the door;—<br>
                        Darkness there and nothing more.<br>
                        <br>
                        Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,<br>
                        Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;<br>
                        But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,<br>
                        And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, “Lenore?”<br>
                        This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, “Lenore!”—<br>
                        Merely this and nothing more.<br>
                        <br>
                        Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,
                        Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.
                        “Surely," said I, “surely that is something at my window lattice;
                        Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore—
                        Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;—
                        ‘Tis the wind and nothing more!”
