                        <h2>Why Choosing the Right Storage Infrastructure.</h2>
                    </header>

                    <p>Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,<br>
                        Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—<br>
                        While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,<br>
                        As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door—<br>
                        "‘Tis some visitor," I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—<br>
                        Only this and nothing more.”<br>
                        <br>
                        Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;<br>
                        And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.<br>
                        Eagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow<br>
                        From my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—<br>
                        For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—<br>
                        Nameless here for evermore.<br>
                        <br>
                        And the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain<br>
                        Thrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;<br>
                        So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating,<br>
                        "‘Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door—<br>
                        Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;—<br>
                        This it is and nothing more.”<br>
                        <br>
                        Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,<br>
                        “Sir," said I, “or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;<br>
                        But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,<br>
                        And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,<br>
                        That I scarce was sure I heard you”—here I opened wide the door;—<br>
                        Darkness there and nothing more.<br>
                        <br>
                        Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,<br>
                        Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;<br>
                        But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,<br>
                        And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, “Lenore?”<br>
                        This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, “Lenore!”—<br>
                        Merely this and nothing more.<br>
                        <br>
                        Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,
                        Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.
                        “Surely," said I, “surely that is something at my window lattice;
                        Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore—
                        Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;—
                        ‘Tis the wind and nothing more!”

                    <p>Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,<br>
                        In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore;<br>
                        Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;<br>
                        But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door—<br>
                        Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door—<br>
                        Perched, and sat, and nothing more.<br>
                        <br>
                        Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,<br>
                        By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,<br>
                        “Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou," I said, “art sure no craven,<br>
                        Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore—<br>
                        Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night’s Plutonian shore!”<br>
                        Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”<br>
                        <br>
                        Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,<br>
                        Though its answer little meaning—little relevancy bore;<br>
                        For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being<br>
                        Ever yet was blest with seeing bird above his chamber door—<br>
                        Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,<br>
                        With such name as “Nevermore.”<br>
                        <br>
                        But the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only<br>
                        That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.<br>
                        Nothing further then he uttered—not a feather then he fluttered—<br>
                        Till I scarcely more than muttered “Other friends have flown before—<br>
                        On the morrow he will leave me, as my hopes have flown before.”<br>
                        Then the bird said “Nevermore.”<br>
                        <br>
                        Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,<br>
                        “Doubtless," said I, “what it utters is its only stock and store<br>
                        Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster<br>
                        Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore—<br>
                        Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore<br>
                        Of ‘Never—nevermore.'"<br>
                        <br>
                        But the Raven still beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,<br>
                        Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door;<br>
                        Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking<br>
                        Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore—<br>
                        What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt and ominous bird of yore<br>
                        Meant in croaking “Nevermore.”<br>
                        <br>
                        This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing<br>
                        To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom’s core;<br>
                        This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining<br>
                        On the cushion’s velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o’er,<br>
                        But whose velvet violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o’er,<br>
                        She shall press, ah, nevermore!<br>
                        <br>
                        Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer<br>
                        Swung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.<br>
                        “Wretch," I cried, “thy God hath lent thee—by these angels he hath sent thee<br>
                        Respite—respite and nepenthe, from thy memories of Lenore;<br>
                        Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!”<br>
                        Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”
                        <br>
                        “Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!—<br>
                        Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,<br>
                        Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted—<br>
                        On this home by Horror haunted—tell me truly, I implore—<br>
                        Is there—is there balm in Gilead?—tell me—tell me, I implore!”<br>
                        Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”<br>
